Become our new recruit and download this action-packed stealth game now!\r\n\r\nJust some of the awesome features:\r\n⛬ Unique stealth play\r\nDynamics shadows and lights offering unique stealth experience\r\n⛬ Many cool gadgets to unlock\r\n ⚬ Night vision goggle\r\n ⚬ Thermal (heat) goggles\r\n ⚬ Stun gun\r\n ⚬ Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons\r\n ⚬ Digital map\r\n ⚬ so much more to come\r\n⛬ Take-downs\r\nNeutralize guards and drag them out of sight\r\n⛬ Multiple campaigns with many missions\r\nSteal priceless items around the world in a full career-mode\r\n⛬ Control the environment\r\nDestroy lights, eliminate security cams\r\n\r\nThe art of stealth\r\nYou will need to operate in complete silence and remain undetected as you steal objects from the most secure locations. Avoid or neutralize guards, sneak past security cameras, and maneuver past anti-theft security laser pointer systems. It's all part of your daily occupation as a notorious thief.\r\n\r\nThe key to completing successful missions in this stealth game is remaining undetected. Use the shadows and any tiny corner to your advantage. You often have multiple options to a situation, will you take-down a guards or will you simply sneak by. While missions can be completed whilst detected, the true art of stealth is to achieve 100% stealth scores for your missions.\r\n\r\nGame-play TIPS\r\n1. Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are. By staying in the dark shadows you will remain invisible to the guards and this allows you to sneak past them undetected.\r\n2. Use gadgets wisely\r\nAs you complete missions you're arsenal of gadgets and gear expands, but your resources remain limited. Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds. Pay close attention to the gadget training missions.\r\n\r\nThe jobs\r\nThis stealth game presents a simulation of the life of a pro modern criminal.

emerged on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors.

Download today and experience for yourself one of the best first person shooter games available on the market! \r\n\r\n\r\n✲✲✲GAME STORY✲✲✲\r\nWe are an advanced civilization. One that has survived, and even thrived from the apocalypse. We are a world with many technical and otherworldly advances that boast the ability to open portals to other dimensions. This was done in order to study the effects of different consequences and alternate reality. It seemed to be safe enough, with all the safety precautions that were taken, but then the unthinkable happened. \r\n\r\nAfter the sustainment system failed during a massive power outage, the safety shield that kept the portal from being accessed by either side was lowered, and the vacuum ripped several agents from their stations, trapping them in these alternate dimensions...\r\n\r\nAs one of these agents sucked inside the portal, you are now trapped in a dimension where the world is drastically different, and all because of a choice made by a handful of men several millennia ago. This world is a treacherous place filled with dangers at every turn. You must remain alive in this bleak world until help can reach you... IF help can reach you.\r\n\r\n✲✲✲GAME PLAY✲✲✲\r\nThe game comes fully loaded with amazing features! Our new game interface is extremely user friendly, and boasts easy to play touch screen controls that allow you to effortlessly run, jump, sprint, reload, aim, shoot and more! \r\n\r\nThe new menu screen includes map style level select and settings screen. Gain game insight in between maps during loading with tip screens, and begin each game with mission style instructions! Before you begin your first level, you can watch a short video ad in order to earn a power up. You may opt not to watch, but you'll lose out on the advantage. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the game begins, a timer will begin to count down. If you are able to beat the level quickly enough, you will earn a permanent weapon, which can be used in all other levels!

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLZ0N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Spider (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31670.9007199266438783.608d1e9f-946a-475c-8fa3-fb013108b76f.d1a00048-bf4e-4380-b822-47b4f734b416","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12759.9007199266438783.76a8d8d5-0839-40d7-afb8-c18936974284.c1e10216-8b84-4a70-a801-e9c6f03ab92a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GASPMobileGamesInc.SpiderFree_9haz0p453120e"],"ContentIds":["36c317a0-65c4-4f2d-0019-1053e835a3a3","9316fd81-8525-e96a-d197-14cf6648a3fd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most popular version of Spider Solitaire was introduced in Windows 98. The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back.
